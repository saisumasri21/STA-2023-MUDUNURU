# Purpose of the project
Professors at universities should assign practical projects to students every semester.These projects may be course specific. 
We are considering mathematics and statistics department projects in our current project.Students should complete such projects 
by applying course concepts.This way, professors can gauge the level of understanding of concepts that each student has and 
change their teaching strategy accordingly. Most of the times, if same project is assigned to whole class, then students would find 
their ways out to complete the project with less efforts. Cheating, giving the project to someone to finish it for money, or 
get the solutions online etc. are few ways students choose to finish the project. To avoid such scenarios, numbers used in the 
project assigned should be different for every student. Grading these projects would be really a tough and time taking task for professors. If the project is assigned to a graduate level class, 
then grading would not be that difficult as the strength of the class is limited to 30 to 40 students per class. 
But if the project is for undergraduate class, students enrolled in that class would be around 400 to 500. 
Grading such projects is really be a time consuming procedure to professors. 

# Description of the project
This online project is designed for STA-2023 course students to check their level of understanding towards the end of the course. 
The entire project revolves around answering questions posed by applying statistical concepts. 
The beauty of the project is that each student has a different dataset. 
Initially a data set with 9 data points is provided to the students. 
Students add their Exam-1 and Exam-2 scores to the dataset by making size of the data set to 11.

# How does this work?
Once students click on the link and open the page, he/she should enter their first name and last name along with their section number. 
After collecting, these details from student, they would be provided with a unique submission number. 
Once students go into the project questions page, they need to enter their Submission ID and type their answers to the questions. 
There are 20 questions and each question is for 5 points. 
The backend is designed in such as way that it calclates actual answers for the respective dataset and compares them with the students answer. 
Based on the comparison, students project score out of 100 points is calculated and stored to a database.
The scores are then submitted to the professor.
